parameters:
    species: "hg38" # Name of species. If you specify the parameter "index_primary" in config.yml, then it should be the same name here
    effective_genome_size: 2913022398 # The effective genome size of the target species. You can find the pre-calculated effective genome size of common species here: https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/develop/content/feature/effectiveGenomeSize.html
    condition: "all" # The condition you want to calculate frips (Don't include parenthese). If you set it to "all", then all conditions' frip values will be generated. If you want to skip one condition instead of all, prefix conditio with "~" (for example, "~wild type"). You can find a specific condition name in metadata generated by fetch_metadata.py
    peak_protein: "CTCF" # Specify which proteins peak you want to calculate frip values base on 
    nproc: 50 # Number of Cpus you want to use

input:
    path_to_metadata: "../data/metadata/Yu_2022/metadata.txt" # Path to metadata generated by fetch_metadata.py, which you can find in fetch_metadata_config.yml
    path_to_data: "../data/ChIP_alignment_outputs/Yu_2022/" # Path to output directory of snakemake, which you can find in config.yml
    path_to_bed: [] # Path to peak bed files you want to use for calculating frip values. By default, you don't need to change this parameter, as the path will be automatically fetched, unless you want to try different bed files. You can add strings to this list e.g. ["/path1/"", "/path2/""].
    path_to_blacklist: '../data/ENCODE_blacklists/hg38-blacklist.v2.bed' # Leave it blank ('') if there is no blacklist. Pathway to the blacklist that indicates genomic regions with systematic biases

output:
    output_directory: "../data/frip_result/Yu_2022/"
